# RAP-inspired-test-suite-generation
Adapts Reasoning via Planning (RAP) for Python testing by modeling generation as an MCTS search. It combines Qwen2.5-Coder with a deterministic execution environment to provide ground-truth coverage rewards. This feedback loop allows the agent to iteratively maximize coverage in complex files, outperforming zero-shot baselines.
